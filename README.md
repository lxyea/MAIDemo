This is a demonstration of maintenance analysis. The study shows the number and costs of preventative and reactive maintenance in certain organization for certain set of maintainable units. The demo has covered following items:

- The data has been used and the preprocess
- The maintenance analysis by organizations
- The maintenance analysis by maintainable units

Following data dimensions are considered in the analysis:

- The maintenance types: pm01, pm02, pm03
- The maintenance cost types: total cost, labour cost, material cost
- The maintainable units operated hours

The analysis concept and approach is from real business, but the data set is after 'masking'. So the chart might not make 'right' business sense, but just demonstrate the shiny app function.
